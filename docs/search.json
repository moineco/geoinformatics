Geoinformatics basically deals with geographic information system (GIS), a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it.\n\n\n\nGeographic Information System"
