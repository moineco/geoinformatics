Geoinformatics basically deals with geographic information system (GIS), a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it. \n\nThe geoinformatics course contents are as below:\n\nSection 1: What is geographic information system (GIS)?\n\n- Lecture 1: Introduction to GIS\n\n- Lecture 2: GIS information provision\n\n- Lecture 3: Geocoding for survey and natural experiment\n\n- Lecture 4: GIS for biodiversity management \n\n- Lecture 5: GIS for natural resource management\n\nSection 2: What is geographic data?\n\n- Lecture 6: Spatial data collection, storage and management\n\n- Lecture 7: Spatial data visualization\n\n- Lecture 8: Spatial data process\n\n- Lecture 9: Spatial data create\n\n- Lecture 10: Spatial data analyze\n\nSection 3: How geographic data can be utilized for the policy analysis?\n\n- Lecture 11: Social applications of GIS\n\n- Lecture 12: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 1)\n\n- Lecture 13: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 2)\n\n- Lecture 14: GIS to solving real world problem ($CO_2$ emission)\n\n- Lecture 15: GIS to solving real world problem (Biodiversity)\n\n\n![Geographic Information System](figures/GIS.png)\n",
